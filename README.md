# ThermoPy

ThermoPy is a Python program designed to solve thermodynamics problems in the terminal. It offers a range of functionalities including calculations for saturation pressure, pressure, and molar volume based on various equations of state, fugacity coefficient, equilibrium liquid-vapor, and application in equipment such as turbines and compressors.

## Installation

ThermoPy is a command-line tool written in Python. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/willbribeiro/ThermoPy.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```
  cd ThermoPy
  ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. Run the main script:

  ```
  python principal.py
  ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompts to input the necessary parameters and perform the desired thermodynamic calculations.
